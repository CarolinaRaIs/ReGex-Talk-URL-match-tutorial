Whether you are a beginner seeking to understand regex or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this tutorial will provide you with the guidance and hands-on practice needed to master URL matching using regex. 

## Summary

This tutorial provides an in-depth explanation of the regular expression ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$ for matching and validating URLs. The regex is designed to handle a wide range of URL variations and components, including the protocol (http or https), domain/subdomain, top-level domain (TLD), and path/query parameters.

The regular expression is as follows:
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

Throughout this tutorial, we will break down the regex into its individual components and explain their functionality. We will cover anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, character classes, and more. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how this regex works and how to utilize it for accurate URL matching and validation.

Please note that this regex is flexible and can handle various URL formats, including both http:// and https:// protocols, alphanumeric domain/subdomain names, TLDs consisting of 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots, and path/query parameters containing forward slashes, alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, and spaces.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are special symbols that mark the beginning (^) and end ($) of a string. In the example above, ^ denotes the start of the string, and $ indicates the end of the string.

^: Matches any string that starts with.
$: Matches a string that ends with.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the quantity of characters or expressions to the left of them that must be matched. There are two types of quantifiers: greedy and lazy(?). The default behavior for quantifiers is greedy, meaning it matches to as many occurrences as possible. To make a quantifier lazy, you can append a ? after the quantifier itself; matching the minimum number of occurrences instead of the maximum.

* and *?: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or expression.
+ and +?: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or expression.
? and ??: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or expression.
{n} and {n}?: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding character or expression.
{n,} and {n,}?: Matches at least n occurrences of the preceding character or expression.
{n,m} and {n,m}?: Matches from n to m occurrences of the preceding character or expression.

Examples:

https?: The '?' makes the s optional, matching both 'https' and 'http'.
[\da-z\.-]+: The '+' matches whats within the brackets one or more times(greedy), with the contents of the bracket containing (\d) which matches a digit (0-9), as well as letters (a-z), dots (.), or hyphens (-).

[a-z\.]{2,6}: The {2,6} matches whats within the brackets between 2 to 6 times(greedy). This indicates that there will be 2-6 copies of the sequence [a-z\.].

[\/\w \.-]*: The '*' matches the contents within the brackets zero or more times(greedy). This means the regex will match even if there are no characters at all, or if the string contains only characters that are in the character class [\/\w \.-] In regular expressions, \w is a shorthand character class that matches any "word" character.
    
    This means \w will match:

    Any lowercase letter a-z
    Any uppercase letter A-Z
    Any digit 0-9
    The underscore character _

This means for [\/\w \.-]* there will be zero or more occurances of '/', any word character equivalent to [a-z0-9_-],'.', '-', 'www', or '//'.

    Why would the regex [\/\w \.-]* match 'www' and '//'?
    'www': Each character is a 'w', which is a lowercase letter, and thus matches the \w part of the character class.

    '//': Each character is a '/', which is specifically included in the character class as \/ (the backslash is used to escape the forward slash, indicating that we want to match the literal character '/', not use it as a regex metacharacter)

### Character Escapes

In regular expressions, some characters have special meanings and are considered metacharacters. To match these characters literally (as regular characters) instead of interpreting their special meanings, you can use the backslash \ as an escape character. When a metacharacter is preceded by a backslash, it loses its special meaning and matches the character itself.

For further explanation:

\.: The backslash \ escapes the metacharacter . (dot), so it matches the character . literally. Without the backslash, . is a metacharacter that matches any character except a newline.
-: In this case, - is not a metacharacter and does not require escaping. It matches the character - literally. However, if - is used within a character class [ ], it can have a special meaning. For example, [a-z] matches any lowercase letter from a to z.
By using backslashes to escape metacharacters, you can match these characters literally instead of their special meaning in regular expressions.
